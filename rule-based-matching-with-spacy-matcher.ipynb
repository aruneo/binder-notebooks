    "## Rule-based matching with `Matcher`\n",
    "**‚úÖüëç Why rule-based matching is awesome üëç‚úÖ**\n",
    "- No training data required (good for smaller datasets)\n",
    "- Match results give you flexibility returning relevant sections from your document.\n",
    "    - i.e. document classification works on whole documents. What if you wanted to find a sentence that was relevant to your business case? The matcher allows you to work with specific sentences and spans after matching.\n",
    "- Fast!\n",
    "- Easy to integrate into an NLP pipeline\n",
    "- Composable and cheap\n",
    "  - e.g. you could write a bunch of quick, simple rules and use boolean logic on the matches to interesting match combinations.\n",
    "  - e.g. you can write a really general rule to find relevant documents, then some mutually exclusive sub-rules that operate only on documents that match a general rule.\n",
    "- Usually explainable to non-technical stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è Why rule-based matching is challenging ‚ö†Ô∏è**\n",
    "- Good rules require lots of iteration and experimentation\n",
    "- Writing rules requires some linguistics knowledge about parts-of-speech and dependency parsing\n",
    "- Token matching operators are greedy\n",
    "  - Requires frequent sanity checking, testing, and iterating to be sure the matcher is returning what you think it is\n",
    "- Requires complementary tools for maximum benefit\n",
    "  - You'll probably want to use an `on_match` callback to work with the full document or a span after a match. Often times the match itself is just the start.\n",
    "  - We train a text classification model on our matches to help us iterate. I found parameter tuning difficult and training very fragile due to the rare outcome rate for matches.\n",

      "FULL: \t My last masher (from a respected and pricey brand name) couldn't take the pressure-literally!  One day I'm just mashing up a batch of potatoes and *snap&#34; it's time for the trash bin.  That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid, heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.  I'm not sure I could break it if I tried!  Works great at mashing (just as good as one with square or circle holes), and the large grip makes it easy to hold even if you get a little butter on your hands (trust me, I have done it).\n",
      "0.98\n",
      "FULL: \t OXO has provided a very nice product at a fair price one again.I buy more and more OXO products, at first I thought that they were expensive yet when you get these spatulas you will appreciate them as I do. When I bought them I thought what would I use the Spoon Shaped one for, Magenta colored one.I use it more then the other two, which is why I bought the set. I find that the graduated size is quite useful.\n",

      "FULL: \t This \"potato masher\" is perfect if you like \"smashed\" potatoes rather than mashed, and you like to leave the skin on your potatoes.  I had the kind with the flat head and holes and it works fine for peeled potatoes.  If I left the peels on, they got stuck in the holes and I kept having to clean them out.  You also end up with smooth potatoes rather than lumpy like I prefer.  So I purchased this \"masher\" and couldn't be happier.  It makes perfect \"smashed\" potatoes and any other root vegetables.  The other thing I use it for (and one reason why I bought this kind of masher) is to break up hamburger or sausage in a frying pan.  It works so much better (and faster) than a wooden spoon.  Just be careful if you are using a non-stick pan not to scrape the bottom of the pan.  Another good use for this masher is to break up whole tomatoes from a can.  Just dump them into a bowl and mash away.Like all other Oxo products, this masher is well made and will probably last for a very long time.\n",

I bought this device and raced them head to head and the next week the hand crank maker was out by the curb for trash collection!This thing works GREAT! Use your imagination and try some fresh fruit sorbets, make a simple syrup and then freeze it with lime juice, for instance -- it's incredible! I find that using instant espresso powder gives me a real coffee flavor kick when I make coffee ice cream. And there's a recipe in the included booklet for Jell-O Pudding Ice Cream, which my kids rave about.I found some apricot juice at the market and used it in the ice cream maker -- it turned out some gourmet-like apricot sorbet! WOW!!!I tend to avoid the heavy cream called for in the recipes and use at most half and half with milk. Too much milkfat tastes gross. Too little tastes icy and awful.It's simple, it works well, it's not all that expensive and the ice cream you'll make is easily better than the most expensive storebought ice cream available! The machine has a small footprint and the only noise it makes is kind of a \"rawr rawr rawr\" as it rotates the central vessel. All you have to do is mix the ice cream base, pour it in the machine and flip the switch!\n",

Here are my pros and cons:PRO- light- bristles work well on thin carpet and throw rugs -- have a feeling it wouldn't work well on thicker carpet- has the option to use as a handheld or a normal vacuumCONS- Annoying to empty - the cannister doesn't fit properly and you have to wiggle it in just so. For something that is supposed to be an easy mid-week run around the house, this turns it into an annoying chore.- The metal handle isn't that stable. It kind of wobbles in the canister. It's not loose, per se, but wobbly enough to be annoying.- The handle doesn't collapse into itself - it clips on or off. So if you're vacuuming and want to use it as a handheld, you have to undo the handle...then what? Hold it? Put it down somewhere and come back later when you need it, usually in another room? Annoying.- Weirdly weighted - the bottom is kind of light but the canister is heavy. It just feels weird when you're driving it around the house. It doesn't turn all that well, and it's light enough to just pick up and reposition where you want it, but the weird weighting makes this more annoying than useful.All in all, it's 'fine' but definitely not great.\n",

It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out. FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced. It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like, but then again, I want perfection and that's not going to happen. It  is quiet enough on the slow setting, and making a fan spin faster does nothing to move air faster (believe it or don't, this is pure physics).Cleaning of this fan is very easy. Simply remove the grill screws, then remove the grills. Then unscrew the blade holder, and pull the blades off the spindle. Wash in hot, soapy water.

It has a nice thin edge that is plenty sharp for cutting into a tray of lasagna, but not sharp enough to cut your fingers. It is well made & very sturdy. I highly recommend this tool to anyone who needs to cut into a tray of food.\n",

      "FULL: \t I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up.\n",

I have a golden retriever, so the vacuum is a little overmatched, but considering it is about $60, I have no complaints whatsoever.I did just buy a more expensive vacuum, which is much better.

So far, the strawberry was the best. Each batch consistently took 25 minutes to make. It's easy to use and easy to clean. I bought the red unit which adds a fun color to my kitchen when not in use. The opening at the top is also convenient for scooping up a spoonful of ice cream for tasting without turning the unit off. I'm sorry I didn't buy this sooner. I love how simple and easy it is to use. I'm going to start experimenting with my own recipes now that I've got the hang of it.The only very minor downside is that it's a little noisy while it's running so you can't really enjoy a quiet meal and make dessert at the same time unless you can stick it in a another room.

It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had, and this machine makes it so easy to make, just pour in the ingredients and turn it on, set a timer and you can relax, when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever!

      "FULL: \t After years of owning 2 versions of this kettle, I am finally writing a review. When OXO first came out with this kettle, I was blown away by its design. Whoever designed this kettle deserves some kind of industrial design award. It is so efficient, simple, elegant, and easy to use, you would think it was designed by Apple. \"Just lift the handle and pour.\" - This kind of simplicity must have been very difficult to engineer.I bought my first OXO kettle when it first came out. I had it for years without any problems whatsoever. I did not have problems with the whistle nor did I have problems with rusting. It was perfect.Unfortunately, I was smitten with the premium \"cork\" version that came out a few years ago and I dumped my first kettle for the newer, sleeker version. Boy, it was beautiful BUT boy, I made a mistake.I had it for 6 months and this OXO Good Grips kettle started rusting inside. My mom bought the black handled version and her kettle rusted too. I too am having problems with the whistle.I should've kept my first kettle. I am sure that when OXO first came out with these kettles that they used 18/10 stainless steel. Not any more. OXO must be using poor, lower grade steel to save costs and raise profits. OXO would disagree with me. Fine. My response to this is: Why do so many of us have rusted out kettles? Check these reviews OXO and fix the problem.In the end this OXO kettle is one product I would gladly pay more money for if I knew that the quality was uncompromised; if the highest grade of stainless steel were used and the whistle were engineered so that it functioned without flaw. Boiling water is a simple, every day task. I don't want to have to think about it and I don't want to have to think about my kettle. This OXO kettle is so close yet so far.\n"

I use it at least twice a week and the ice cream comes out perfect every time. When first made, the ice cream is about the consistency of soft serve or a Wendy's Frosty. That's just fine with me, the flavor is best this way. After freezing whatever is left of the batch, the consistency is like store bought ice cream. I do not do anything fancy with it, just follow the directions in the included booklet for basic vanilla ice cream. In fact, the recipe calls for heavy cream and whole milk but I substitute 1 cup Half & Half and 2 cups low fat (2%) milk to keep it lower cal, and the consistency is still plenty smooth!Like other reviewers have said, be sure to freeze that container for plenty of time before using. Otherwise the ice cream will be real runny. I try to freeze it for 24 hours before use. As long as the directions are followed on this machine, it makes great ice cream every time.

I cook everything in cast iron nowadays, and the best way to get out tough residue it to fill the pan half way with water and bring to a slow boil.  from there the brush gets all of the tough stuff out. Then I sent the pan back on the stove for a couple of minutes under heat so the condensation evaporates.  then I spray with oil and let cool so I can store it.

      "FULL: \t This is a very lightweight, all plastic vacuum - not really a true canister vac.  I purchased this vac solely for use in vacuuming my automobiles and it is perfect for that.  The unit is extremely light - perhaps only four pounds or so - meaning that it can easily be lifted and moved around.  It is small - about 16 inches long by 6 inches wide by 8 inches tall - so it will easily sit on a car seat while being used.  Alternately, the hose in long enough so that the \"canister\" unit can be left on the ground outside the car.The angled arm end makes it easy to get under the front car seats while keeping the small head attachment against the carpet for full suction.  As well, the small head attachment is double-headed.  It features a three inch flat head on one side and a bristled upholstery brush on the other - convenient for flipping between car carpets and upholstery.  The only tool that is lacking somewhat is the narrow wand used for getting into tight places.  The wand is designed with a notch cut up into it, so you cannot achieve full suction.  The bag is large enough that you could vacuum dozens of full sized cars before having to change it.  The unit functions perfectly for such use, but it is a bit noisy and gets very hot from even a couple of minutes use.  Nevertheless, the light weight, light duty attributes of this vac means that its design functions well for light work such as vacuuming cars.However, it should be noted that this is a vacuum that costs far less than one hundred dollars, so one should not expect a true, heavy-duty canister vac.  It is a very light duty vacuum and not one that I would consider using extensively in my house.  The unit is a noisier than mid- or high-end vacuums and at four pounds with rather cheap all-plastic construction with a motor that gets very hot rather quickly, it doesn't have the feel of a vacuum that would last more than a year or two with household use. As well, the full-size floor head is a lightweight plastic unit that attaches via two hard plastic hose lengths - not a fixed, full-size arm - thus use on household carpets or floors would be awkward for some.I like this unit and am very happy with its performance for the use for which I purchased it, but anyone purchasing it for extensive household use might consider this as an auxillary or supplemental vacuum and not the single unit for such use.\n",

Use your imagination and try some fresh fruit sorbets, make a simple syrup and then freeze it with lime juice, for instance -- it's incredible! I find that using instant espresso powder gives me a real coffee flavor kick when I make coffee ice cream. And there's a recipe in the included booklet for Jell-O Pudding Ice Cream, which my kids rave about.I found some apricot juice at the market and used it in the ice cream maker -- it turned out some gourmet-like apricot sorbet! WOW!!!I tend to avoid the heavy cream called for in the recipes and use at most half and half with milk. Too much milkfat tastes gross. Too little tastes icy and awful.It's simple, it works well, it's not all that expensive and the ice cream you'll make is easily better than the most expensive storebought ice cream available!

Also, this might just be me, but I'm not totally comfortable using the bowl to serve from as others have described.
